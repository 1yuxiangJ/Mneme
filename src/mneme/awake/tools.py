"""LangGraph @tool definitions for the Awake agent.

These wrap mneme.memory.store CRUD with awake_agent actor.

Mapping from MCP-exposed tools (mcp_server.py) → internal tools:
  MCP `remember`     → search_archival (dedup) + insert_archival
  MCP `recall`       → load_core (context) + search_archival
  MCP `list_memory`  → get_overview
  MCP `forget`       → forget_archival

The Awake agent's ReAct loop chooses which internal tools to call.
