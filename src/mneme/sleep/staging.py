"""Staging snapshot + atomic swap for Sleep agent.

Concurrency model (Letta-paper-inspired, MVP-simplified):

  1. snapshot_to_staging()
     - DROP + CREATE  *_staging  (LIKE main INCLUDING ALL)
     - INSERT INTO   *_staging   SELECT * FROM main
     - Records snapshot_ts.

  2. Sleep agent works only on `*_staging` tables.

  3. atomic_swap()
     - In a single transaction:
         a) Briefly block archival writers while still allowing readers
         b) Move any new archival rows from main → staging
            (created_at > snapshot_ts, skip if already present)
         c) Merge Awake-owned usage fields from main into existing staging rows
         d) Use a three-step RENAME for each main ↔ staging pair
         e) Truncate the now-staging (old main).
     - Awake's next read picks up the new main.

Field ownership during the merge:
  - Sleep semantic fields (content/tags/confidence/etc.) stay in staging.
  - Awake usage fields (use_count/last_used_at) take the freshest value.
  - is_deleted is monotonic: a delete by either agent remains deleted.
