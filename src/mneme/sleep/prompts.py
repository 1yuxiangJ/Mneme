"""Sleep agent prompt templates (Letta sleep-time compute).

Each prompt is a stage in the Sleep cycle. The cycle is orchestrated by
sleep/agent.py:run_sleep_cycle as a LangGraph StateGraph; each node fills
in the variables and calls the chat LLM with the rendered prompt.

CRITICAL POLICY (encoded into every prompt):
- The Sleep agent is the ONLY actor allowed to modify core_blocks.
- Awake agent only writes archival; you (Sleep) promote / consolidate.
- Be conservative — when in doubt, do nothing.
- Always log reason for every change (returned in tool calls / final output).

These prompts will need iteration once real LLM traffic flows. Day 03
locks the structure; Day 05+ tunes the wording based on observed behavior.

Below is a summary of the current memory state. Decide which phases are worth
running this cycle. Skip phases that have nothing to do.

Memory state:
{state_summary}

Phases available:
1. consolidate — merge near-duplicate archival facts (cosine > 0.85)
2. promote    — lift frequent, explicit, durable, useful archival into core blocks
3. demote     — soft-delete archival that's stale and low-signal
4. resolve    — detect & fix contradictions within core blocks
5. reflect    — write a one-paragraph "about the user" snapshot to ops log

Constraints:
- If archival_count < {min_archival}: skip everything except reflect.
- If no archival created since last cycle: skip consolidate.
- Always include reflect at the end of a productive cycle (it's cheap, gives
  the human something to inspect).
